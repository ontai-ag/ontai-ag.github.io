## 1. Google Search Console

    *   Monitor your site's performance in Google search results (impressions, clicks, average position).
    *   Identify and fix crawl errors that Googlebot encounters.
    *   Submit your XML sitemap(s) to help Google discover your content.
    *   Receive notifications about security issues (like malware) or manual actions.
    *   Check your site's mobile usability.
    *   Analyze Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS) which impact user experience and rankings.
    *   See the search queries (keywords) users are typing to find your site.
    *   Understand how well Google is indexing your pages.
*   **Cost**: Free.
*   **How to Use**: You'll need to verify ownership of your website to access its data.

## 2. Google PageSpeed Insights

*   **Purpose**: This tool analyzes the loading speed and user experience of a specific web page on both mobile and desktop devices. It provides:
    *   Real-world data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) for Core Web Vitals (if available for your page).
    *   Lab data (performance scores) based on Lighthouse for loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.
    *   Specific, actionable recommendations on how to improve page speed (e.g., optimize images, reduce server response times, eliminate render-blocking resources).

*   **How to Use**: Simply enter the URL of the page you want to test.

## 3. Google Analytics

*   **Purpose**: Google Analytics is a powerful web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic and user behavior. Key uses include:
    *   Monitoring overall website traffic (sessions, users, pageviews).
    *   Understanding user behavior (bounce rate, pages per session, average session duration).
    *   Tracking conversions and goals (e.g., form submissions, purchases, downloads).
    *   Analyzing the performance of specific content (which pages are most popular).
    *   Gathering insights into your audience demographics, interests, and acquisition channels (how they found your site).
*   **Cost**: Free (the standard version, GA4, is free). There's a paid version (Google Analytics 360) for very large enterprises.
*   **How to Use**: You'll need to add a tracking code to your website.

## 4. Google's Mobile-Friendly Test

*   **Purpose**: This is a quick and straightforward tool to check if a specific page on your website is considered mobile-friendly by Google. Given Google's mobile-first indexing, this is crucial.
    *   It tests if your page layout adapts to small screens, if text is readable without zooming, and if tap targets are appropriately sized.
*   **Cost**: Free.
*   **How to Use**: Enter the URL of the page you want to check.

## 5. Third-Party SEO Audit Tools (General Mention)

While Google's tools are excellent, comprehensive third-party SEO platforms offer broader and often deeper insights into your site's overall SEO health, competitive landscape, and specific technical issues.

    *   **Screaming Frog SEO Spider**: A desktop program that crawls websites (like a search engine bot) to identify common technical SEO issues. It's excellent for in-depth technical audits, finding broken links, analyzing page titles and meta descriptions, understanding site structure, and much more.
*   **Purpose**: These tools are designed for:
    *   **Comprehensive Site Audits**: Identifying a wide range of technical SEO problems (e.g., broken links, redirect chains, duplicate content, crawlability issues).
    *   **On-Page Issue Analysis**: Checking for optimal use of titles, meta descriptions, header tags, image alt text, etc.
    *   **Backlink Analysis**: Examining your website's backlink profile and identifying opportunities.
    *   **Keyword Tracking**: Monitoring your website's ranking for target keywords.
    *   **Competitor Research**: Analyzing what your competitors are doing well in terms of content, keywords, and backlinks.

    *   **Limited free versions**: Allowing you to test some features or run a small number of reports.
    *   **Free trials**: Providing full access for a short period.
    *   Screaming Frog SEO Spider has a free version that can crawl up to 500 URLs, which is very useful for smaller sites or initial checks.

## 6. Browser Developer Tools

*   **Purpose**: Modern web browsers (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari) come with powerful built-in developer tools. These are invaluable for real-time analysis and debugging directly in your browser:
    *   **Inspect HTML/CSS**: View and modify the HTML structure and CSS styling of your pages to troubleshoot layout or styling issues.
    *   **Debug JavaScript**: Identify and fix errors in your JavaScript code.
    *   **Check Network Requests**: See all the files (images, scripts, CSS) a page loads, their size, and how long they take to load. This helps identify bottlenecks.
    *   **Emulate Mobile Devices**: Simulate how your page looks and behaves on various mobile devices and screen resolutions.
    *   **Performance Audits**: Some browser dev tools (especially Chrome's Lighthouse panel) can run performance audits, similar to PageSpeed Insights, directly in the browser.
*   **Cost**: Free (built into your browser).
*   **How to Use**: Typically accessed by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," or by pressing F12.
